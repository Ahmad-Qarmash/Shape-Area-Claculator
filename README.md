# ShellScriptingTraining

### Write a bash script that will calculate area of a shape (square, rectangle, circle or triangle).

*	The script will show a menu of above options + exit option that will stop the script. 

*	Ask the user to input option in number and validate input (you should ask user to inter option again if it was not correct).

*	Ask the user to input needed parameters to calculate the shape area one by one (ex: height and width for rectangle) and validate input.

*	Then print area of the shape to the screen in a good format.

*	Then store the calculated area to a file with format (Shape: Area).

*	Then displays the above menu again till exit option is entered.

## When exit option is entered:
*	Read file that contains calculated shape areas.

*	Store shapes and their areas into arrays.

*	Loop through arrays and print all calculated areas in the format: (Shape : Area)

*	Remove file.

*	Exit the script.

## Please consider using:
*	Variables to store user input and area.

*	Functions at least one for each shape option.
